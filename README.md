# Vue.js CRUD Product App

A Product Management App built with Vue 3 using the **`Composition API syntax`**. It provides essential **CRUD functionality** â€” **`add`**, **`view`**, and **`delete`** products. The app is styled with **`Bootstrap 5`** for responsive design and uses **`Axios`** for making HTTP requests. Product data is managed using **`json-server`**, providing a mock backend API for development and prototyping. This app is ideal for learning how to use the Composition API in **`Vue 3`** and building modern web applications with **`state management via Vuex`**.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue 3**: The app is built using Vue 3, leveraging the Composition API with the new syntax (`setup()`, `ref`, `reactive`, `computed`, etc.).
- **Vuex 4**: Used for state management, allowing the app to manage the global state of products and perform CRUD operations.
- **Axios**: Used for making HTTP requests to the backend (`json-server` or a similar REST API).
- **Bootstrap 5**: Used for UI styling to quickly build a responsive design for the app.
- **Vite**: The project uses Vite for fast development builds and optimized production builds.
